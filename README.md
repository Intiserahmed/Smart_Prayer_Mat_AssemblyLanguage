# Smart Sajadah/Prayer Mat Simulator

This project is a simulation of a Smart Sajadah/Prayer Mat using MIPS programming in MARS Simulator. The goal of the simulation is to demonstrate how the Smart Sajadah/Prayer Mat can use input sensors and output actuators to provide guidance and feedback to a person during prayer.

## Requirements

To run this simulation, you will need:
- MARS Simulator
- MIPS programming knowledge


## Features

The Smart Sajadah/Prayer Mat simulator includes the following features:
- Three input sensors (position sensor, speed sensor, and ??? sensor)
- Three output actuators (counter display, alert display, and ??? actuator)
- Guidance and feedback during prayer based on input sensor data
- Incrementation of the rakaah counter based on position sensor data
- Display of required recitations based on position sensor data
- Alert display if the person moves too quickly based on speed sensor data

## Usage

To use this simulator, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open MARS Simulator and load the MIPS program file
3. Connect the input sensors and output actuators to the appropriate ports on your machine
4. Run the simulation
6. Follow the guidance and feedback provided by the input sensors and output actuators
7. End the prayer session
